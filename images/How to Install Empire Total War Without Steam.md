## Method 1: Install from DVD and Play Offline
 
If you have bought the retail DVD version of Empire Total War, you can install the game from the disc and play it offline without Steam. Here are the steps to do so:
 
1. Insert the Empire Total War DVD into your computer and follow the installation instructions.
2. Launch Steam and create an account if you don't have one already.
3. Go to the Library tab and click on Add a Game at the bottom left corner.
4. Select Activate a Product on Steam and enter the product key that came with your DVD.
5. Wait for Steam to verify your game and download any necessary updates.
6. Once the game is ready, go to the Steam menu and select Go Offline.
7. Restart Steam in offline mode and launch Empire Total War from your library.
8. Enjoy playing the game without Steam!

## Method 2: Download a No-Steam Patch
 
If you don't have the DVD version of Empire Total War or you don't want to use Steam at all, you can download a no-steam patch that will allow you to run the game without it. A no-steam patch is a modified executable file that bypasses the Steam check and launches the game directly. However, be aware that using a no-steam patch may violate the terms of service of Steam and Empire Total War, and may expose your computer to viruses or malware. Use this method at your own risk and discretion. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Download a no-steam patch for Empire Total War from a reputable source. You can search online for one or use this link as an example: https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc\_empire\_total\_war.shtml
2. Extract the no-steam patch file to your Empire Total War installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Empire Total War.
3. Make a backup copy of your original Empire.exe file in case you want to restore it later.
4. Rename the no-steam patch file to Empire.exe and replace the original one.
5. Launch Empire Total War from the new Empire.exe file and play without Steam!
