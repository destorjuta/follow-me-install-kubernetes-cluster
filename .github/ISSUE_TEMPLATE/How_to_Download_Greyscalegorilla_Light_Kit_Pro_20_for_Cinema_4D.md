To use Greyscalegorilla Light Kit Pro 2.0, you need to open a new or existing scene in Cinema 4D and go to Plugins > Greyscalegorilla > Light Kit Browser. This will open a window where you can see all the presets and options available for the plugin.
 
You can browse through the categories and subcategories of presets by clicking on the icons on the left side of the window. You can also use the search bar at the top to find a specific preset by name or keyword. To preview a preset, simply hover over it with your mouse cursor and you will see a thumbnail of how it looks on a sample scene.
 
To apply a preset, just double-click on it and it will be added to your scene. You can then adjust the position, rotation, scale, color, intensity, falloff, shadows, reflections, and other parameters of each light by using the sliders and modifiers on the right side of the window.

If you want to create your own custom light setup from scratch, you can use the Add Light button at the top of the window to add different types of lights to your scene. You can choose from softboxes, spotlights, ring lights, overhead lights, ambient lights, and more. You can then edit each light individually or as a group by using the same sliders and modifiers as before.
 
Once you are happy with your lighting setup, you can save it as a new preset by using the Save Preset button at the top of the window. You can then name your preset and assign it to a category and subcategory of your choice. You can also share your preset with other
