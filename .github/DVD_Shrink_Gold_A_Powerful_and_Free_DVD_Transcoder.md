DVD Shrink Gold is based on the original DVD Shrink software, which was discontinued in 2005. The latest version of DVD Shrink Gold is 3.2.0.15, which was released in 2012. It has improved compatibility with newer DVDs, faster encoding speed, and more options for customization.
 
One of the advantages of DVD Shrink Gold is that it is completely free and does not require any registration or activation. However, this also means that it does not have any official support or updates. Some users may encounter problems with newer DVDs or Windows versions, or experience bugs and errors.
 
Another issue with DVD Shrink Gold is that it may be hard to find a reliable and safe download source. Some websites may offer fake or malicious versions of the software, or bundle it with unwanted programs or malware. Some users may also be tempted to download a cracked or torrented version of the software, which may contain viruses or spyware.
 
Therefore, it is important to be careful when downloading and installing DVD Shrink Gold. Users should only download it from trusted and reputable websites, such as dvdshrink.info or dvdshrink.org. They should also scan the downloaded file with an antivirus program before running it. They should also avoid using any cracked or torrented versions of the software, as they may harm their computer or compromise their security.
 
DVD Shrink Gold is a powerful and free DVD transcoder program that can help users back up their DVD collection. However, it also has some limitations and risks that users should be aware of. Users should use it with caution and at their own discretion.
  
How to use DVD Shrink Gold
 
Using DVD Shrink Gold is relatively easy and straightforward. Users just need to follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the DVD disc that they want to back up into their DVD drive.
2. Launch DVD Shrink Gold and click on the "Open Disc" button. The program will analyze the disc and display its contents.
3. Select the parts of the disc that they want to keep or remove. They can use the "Re-author" mode to create a custom DVD, or the "Full Disc" mode to copy the entire disc. They can also adjust the compression level and quality of the output.
4. Click on the "Backup!" button and choose a destination folder for the output files. They can also choose to burn the output directly to a blank disc, or create an ISO image file.
5. Wait for the program to finish transcoding and copying the DVD.

DVD Shrink Gold is compatible with most DVD burning software, such as Nero or ImgBurn. Users can use these programs to burn the output files or ISO image to a blank disc.
